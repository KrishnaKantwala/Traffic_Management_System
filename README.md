# Traffic Management System

The project is to help the local police department with their installation of security cameras at traffc intersections. 
Solved a particular kind of optimization problem, called the Vertex Cover problem, in this context. 
The idea is for the police to be able to minimize the number of cameras they need to install, and still be as effective as possible with their monitoring.

- Minimized the number of cameras needed to install at traffic intersection by an optimized solution of vertex cover problem.
- Used Inter-Process Communication(IPC) in diver program to link output of Python scripts to the input of C++ program.
- Calculated minimum vertex cover using MiniSAT Library(a SAT Solver)
